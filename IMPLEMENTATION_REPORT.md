# GitHub Pages Implementation - Completion Report

## What Was Implemented

A complete GitHub Pages website has been created for the Jetson CV Hub repository that automatically pulls documentation from the main branch and deploys it as a user-friendly website.

## Files Created

### 1. Website Files (`docs-site/`)
- **index.html** - Landing page with project overview, features, and getting started guide
- **assembly.html** - Assembly instructions page (dynamically loads from docs/ASSEMBLY_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- **setup.html** - Setup instructions page (dynamically loads from docs/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
- **quick-start.html** - Quick start guide page (dynamically loads from QUICK_START.md)
- **bom.html** - Bill of Materials page (dynamically loads from BOM.md)
- **css/style.css** - Professional styling with NVIDIA branding colors
- **README.md** - Documentation for the site structure

### 2. Automation
- **.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml** - GitHub Actions workflow that:
  - Triggers on every push to main branch
  - Builds the site by copying HTML/CSS and documentation files
  - Deploys to GitHub Pages automatically
  - Can also be triggered manually

### 3. Documentation
- **GITHUB_PAGES_SETUP.md** - Complete setup guide for enabling GitHub Pages
- **figures/README.md** - Instructions for adding images/figures to documentation

### 4. Repository Updates
- **README.md** - Updated with link to GitHub Pages site and new structure

## How It Works

### Content Flow
```
Main Branch (Source of Truth)
    â†“
    â”œâ”€â”€ README.md â†’ Landing page content
    â”œâ”€â”€ docs/ASSEMBLY_INSTRUCTIONS.md â†’ Assembly page
    â”œâ”€â”€ docs/SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md â†’ Setup page
    â”œâ”€â”€ QUICK_START.md â†’ Quick start page
    â”œâ”€â”€ BOM.md â†’ BOM page
    â””â”€â”€ figures/ â†’ Images for all pages
    â†“
GitHub Actions Workflow
    â†“
Build & Deploy
    â†“
GitHub Pages (Live Website)
```

### Key Features

1. **Automatic Updates**: When any documentation file is updated on the main branch, the website updates automatically within minutes

2. **Single Source of Truth**: All documentation stays in the repository as markdown files - no need to maintain separate website content

3. **Figure Support**: The `figures/` directory is automatically copied to the site, allowing images to be referenced in markdown files

4. **Responsive Design**: The site works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

5. **Professional Appearance**: 
   - NVIDIA branding colors (green: #76b900)
   - Clean, modern design
   - Easy navigation between pages
   - Styled code blocks, tables, and lists

6. **Direct GitHub Integration**: Navigation includes direct links back to the GitHub repository

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
After this PR is merged to main:

1. Go to: https://github.com/SasaKuruppuarachchi/jetson-cv-hub/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment"
3. Set **Source** to: `GitHub Actions`
4. Save

### Step 2: Wait for Deployment
1. Go to the Actions tab: https://github.com/SasaKuruppuarachchi/jetson-cv-hub/actions
2. Watch the "Deploy GitHub Pages" workflow run
3. Once completed (green checkmark), your site is live!

### Step 3: Access Your Site
Visit: https://sasakuruppuarachchi.github.io/jetson-cv-hub/

## Testing the Site

### Before Deployment
The workflow has been configured but won't run until merged to main branch.

### After Deployment
1. Visit the main landing page and verify:
   - Content matches README.md
   - Navigation works
   - Hero section displays correctly
   - All sections are styled properly

2. Test documentation pages:
   - Click "Assembly" - should load assembly instructions
   - Click "Setup" - should load setup instructions
   - Click "Quick Start" - should load quick start guide
   - Click "BOM" - should load bill of materials

3. Test responsiveness:
   - Resize browser window
   - View on mobile device
   - Verify navigation collapses appropriately

## Adding Images/Figures

To add images that will appear on the website:

1. Create subdirectories in `figures/` as needed:
   ```
   figures/
   â”œâ”€â”€ assembly/
   â”œâ”€â”€ hardware/
   â””â”€â”€ diagrams/
   ```

2. Add your images to the appropriate directory

3. Reference them in your markdown documentation:
   ```markdown
   ![Camera Installation](../figures/assembly/camera-install.jpg)
   ```

4. Commit and push to main branch - the site will update automatically!

## Customization

### Changing Colors
Edit `docs-site/css/style.css` and modify the CSS variables:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #76b900;     /* NVIDIA green */
    --secondary-color: #333;      /* Dark gray */
    --accent-color: #ff6c00;      /* Orange */
}
```

### Adding New Pages
1. Create a new HTML file in `docs-site/` following the pattern of existing pages
2. Add navigation links to all HTML files
3. Update the workflow if new markdown files need to be copied

## Troubleshooting

### Site Not Deploying
- Check Actions tab for workflow errors
- Verify GitHub Pages is set to "GitHub Actions"
- Ensure workflow file has proper permissions

### Markdown Not Loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify markdown files exist in the repository
- Check file paths in HTML files

### Images Not Showing
- Verify images are in `figures/` directory
- Check image paths in markdown (use relative paths like `../figures/image.png`)
- Ensure workflow copies the `figures/` directory

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Documentation changes in markdown files automatically update the site
- No manual website updates needed
- The workflow handles everything automatically

### Monitoring
- Check the Actions tab periodically to ensure deployments succeed
- GitHub will email you if a workflow fails

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- Static HTML/CSS for structure and styling
- JavaScript with marked.js for markdown rendering
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
- GitHub Pages for hosting

### Performance
- Fast load times (static site)
- CDN delivery through GitHub Pages
- Optimized for web performance

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## Success Criteria

âœ… Site structure created
