## Overview

The Jetson CV Hub is a versatile, reconfigurable computer vision platform designed for robotics and machine vision research. It integrates:

- **FLIR Machine Vision Cameras**: High-quality imaging for computer vision applications with hardware synchronization
- **Xsense IMU**: Precision inertial measurement for motion tracking and sensor fusion
- **PX4 Flight Controller**: Master timing source for hardware synchronization (100 Hz trigger), provides redundant IMU, enables easy low-level control and direct deployability to drones
- **NVIDIA Jetson Orin**: Powerful onboard computing with GPU acceleration
- **Onboard Power**: Integrated power management for all components
- **Modular Design**: 3D printable housing with reconfigurable mounting options

### Hardware Synchronization

The system features precise hardware synchronization with PX4 as the master device producing trigger signals at 100 Hz. The cameras and Xsense IMU are connected in parallel to receive synchronized timing signals, ensuring accurate temporal alignment for visual-inertial applications.
